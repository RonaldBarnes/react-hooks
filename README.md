# react-hooks
React hooks demo portfolio: built-in hooks plus custom ones for personal toolkit.


This repo is an implementation of the React Hooks course that Kyle Cook (WebDev Simplified) offered (something like this YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c6znExIqRw&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH-aEDXnaFNLsqiJWFpIWV03).


There are instances of all the built-in React hooks, plus dozens of custom ones that make handy 
additions to any developer's toolkit.


Also, an excellent opportunity to "Think in React".

Also, at least one hook that is entirely my own creation (useSourceCode - source code with syntax highlighting).
